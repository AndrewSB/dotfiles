# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I use on macOS.

There is also a pretty awesome install script in [`ensure-machine-setup.sh`](https://github.com/AndrewSB/dotfiles/blob/master/machine-setup-functions.sh), it uses functions from [`machine-setup-functions.sh`](https://github.com/AndrewSB/dotfiles/blob/master/ensure-machine-setup.sh)

# TODO:

## install script
- spawn oh-my-zsh installation into it's own process
- add sys pref stuff
	- zoom config
	- caps modifier -> control 
	- allow screen sharing
	- hide dock
- setup terminal background color & font size

## general
- auto install some of the apps.md

## zshrc
- add https://github.com/mroth/scmpuff
- add a stack for directories, a la [bkase](https://github.com/bkase/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc#L88)
- improve the swift prompt - currently taking ~800 milliseconds to load prompt every time
