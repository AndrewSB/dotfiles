# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I use on macOS.

There is also a pretty awesome install script in `ensure-machine-setup.sh`

# TODO:

- auto install some of the apps.md
- make the directory turn into a github repo notation if in a git repo
- move RPROMPT to its own line, above PROMPT
- add https://github.com/mroth/scmpuff
- add a stack for directories, a la [bkase](https://github.com/bkase/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc#L88)
